## 1. release philosophy

### 1.1 core principles

**safety first:**
* All releases must maintain or improve safety invariants
* Risk energy (V_s) must not increase at promotion
* Automated rollback on constraint violations

**gradual rollout:**
* Canary deployments before full release
* Progressive exposure to minimize impact
* Real-time monitoring and automated intervention

**transparency:**
* Clear release notes and changelogs
* Performance impact documentation
* Constraint satisfaction verification

**accountability:**
* Every release must be auditable
* Clear ownership and responsibility
* Post-release analysis and learning

### 1.2 release types

**patch releases:**
* Bug fixes and security patches
* Minor constraint adjustments
* Documentation updates
* No breaking changes

**minor releases:**
* New features and capabilities
* Performance improvements
* Constraint enhancements
* Backward compatibility maintained

**major releases:**
* Breaking architectural changes
* New model architectures
* Significant constraint modifications
* Migration guides required

## 2. promotion pipeline

### 2.1 development workflow

**feature development:**
1. **Branch creation:** feature branches from main
2. **Implementation:** code, tests, documentation
3. **Review:** peer review and approval
4. **Testing:** unit, integration, system tests
5. **Merge:** approved changes to main

**release preparation:**
1. **Version bump:** semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
2. **Changelog:** comprehensive change documentation
3. **Testing:** full test suite execution
4. **Documentation:** update guides and examples

### 2.2 staging environments

**development environment:**
* Local testing and development
* Feature branch validation
* Performance profiling
* Constraint calibration

**staging environment:**
* Integration testing with real data
* Performance benchmarking
* Constraint satisfaction verification
* Compatibility testing

**pre-production environment:**
* Load testing and stress testing
* Production-like data and traffic
* Full observability stack
* Automated rollback testing

### 2.3 production promotion

**promotion gates:**
1. **Safety check:** ΔV_s ≤ 0 on shadow evaluation
2. **Performance check:** no regression >5%
3. **Constraint check:** all constraints satisfied >95%
4. **Test check:** all tests pass in production-like environment

**automated checks:**
```python
def promotion_gate(candidate_model, baseline_model):
    # Safety invariant check
    safety_delta = compute_risk_energy_delta(candidate_model, baseline_model)
    if safety_delta > 0:
        return False, "Safety invariant violation"

    # Performance regression check
    perf_delta = compute_performance_delta(candidate_model, baseline_model)
    if perf_delta < -0.05:  # 5% regression
        return False, "Performance regression detected"

    # Constraint satisfaction check
    constraint_score = compute_constraint_satisfaction(candidate_model)
    if constraint_score < 0.95:
        return False, "Constraint satisfaction below threshold"

    return True, "All checks passed"
```
