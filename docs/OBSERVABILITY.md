## 1. metrics schema

### 1.1 core metrics hierarchy

**system health:**
* **Availability:** uptime percentage, service health checks
* **Performance:** response times, throughput, error rates
* **Resource utilization:** CPU, GPU, memory, disk, network

**model performance:**
* **Accuracy:** task completion rates, constraint satisfaction
* **Efficiency:** tokens per second, energy per inference
* **Quality:** grammar compliance, plan execution success

**constraint monitoring:**
* **Grammar compliance:** CFG energy, token masking violations
* **Plan execution:** DAG validation rates, precondition failures
* **Safety invariants:** risk energy levels, constraint violations

### 1.2 metric definitions

**response time metrics:**
```python
class ResponseTimeMetrics:
    def __init__(self):
        self.p50 = 0.0    # Median response time
        self.p95 = 0.0    # 95th percentile
        self.p99 = 0.0    # 99th percentile
        self.mean = 0.0   # Average response time

    def update(self, response_time: float):
        # Update percentile calculations
        # Rolling window or exponential moving average
        pass
```

**constraint satisfaction metrics:**
```python
