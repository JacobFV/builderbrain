# Example authorization check
def check_access(user: User, permission: Permission) -> bool:
    if not user.has_role(permission.resource):
        return False

    # Check conditions

    # Find all user data across systems
    user_data_locations = await find_user_data(user_id)

    # Delete from primary systems
    for location in user_data_locations:
        await secure_delete(location)

    # Update audit logs (preserve deletion record)
    await log_deletion(user_id, "GDPR request")

    # Notify data processors
