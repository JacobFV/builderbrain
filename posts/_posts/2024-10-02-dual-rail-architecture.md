excerpt: "How BuilderBrain uses two neural pathways - one frozen, one learned - to combine pretrained capabilities with compositional reasoning."

## The Core Problem

Traditional approaches to extending large language models have a fundamental tradeoff:

- **Fine-tuning**: Adapts the model but loses pretrained capabilities and can cause catastrophic forgetting
- **Prompting**: Preserves pretrained knowledge but limits compositional reasoning
- **External tools**: Clean separation but no integrated reasoning

BuilderBrain solves this with a **dual-rail architecture** that maintains the best of both worlds.

## What is Dual-Rail Architecture?

Instead of modifying the base model, BuilderBrain adds a parallel "builder rail" that learns to compose behaviors while keeping the original model frozen.

## The Two Rails Explained

### Base Rail (Frozen)
- **What it does**: Standard transformer processing
- **What's frozen**: All parameters remain unchanged
- **Why frozen**: Preserves pretrained knowledge and capabilities
- **Output**: Hidden states `h^B` at each layer

### Builder Rail (Learned)
- **What it does**: Learns compositional reasoning patterns
- **What's learned**: Cross-attention and composition logic
- **Input**: Base rail hidden states + program selection
- **Output**: Composed representations `h^C` at each layer

## How They Work Together

The magic happens in the **fusion gates**:

```python
# At each layer:
alpha = fusion_gate(base_state, builder_state)  # Learned gating
fused_state = alpha * builder_state + (1 - alpha) * base_state
```

Where `alpha ∈ [0,1]` controls how much influence each rail has.

## Program Selection: Discrete Skills

The builder rail learns to select from **discrete program skills**:

```python
# Learnable program embeddings
program_logits = program_head(builder_state)
program_probs = softmax(program_logits)
selected_program = gumbel_softmax(program_logits)  # Discrete selection
```

Each program represents a reusable skill like "grasp", "rotate", "place", etc.

## Why This Architecture Works

### 1. **Preserves Pretrained Knowledge**
The base rail stays frozen, so all that expensive pretraining isn't lost.

### 2. **Enables Composition**
The builder rail learns to combine skills into complex behaviors.

### 3. **Provides Control**
Fusion gates let you dynamically control the base vs builder influence.

### 4. **Maintains Trainability**
Only the builder components need training, keeping it efficient.

## Code Example

Here's how it works in practice:

```python
from bb_nn.dual_rail import DualRail
from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel

# Load frozen base model
base_model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained('gpt2')

# Create dual-rail model
model = DualRail(
    base_model=base_model,
    hidden_size=768,
    num_layers=12,
    num_programs=32,  # 32 discrete skills
    alpha_cap=0.1     # Limit builder influence initially
)

# Forward pass
outputs = model(input_ids)
base_states = outputs['base_states']      # Frozen representations
builder_states = outputs['builder_states'] # Composed representations
program_logits = outputs['program_logits'] # Skill selection
```

## Training Dynamics

During training, the system learns to:
1. **Select appropriate programs** for different contexts
2. **Compose skills** into coherent plans
3. **Balance base vs builder** influence via fusion gates
4. **Respect constraints** (grammar, safety, etc.)

## Real-World Impact

This architecture enables:
- **API Agents**: Structured JSON generation with error handling
- **Robotics**: Safe manipulation with collision avoidance
- **Code Generation**: Syntactically correct programs
- **Business Logic**: Executable workflows with validation

## Next Steps

In the next post, we'll dive into [grammar constraints](/ai/ml/nlp/grammars/2024/10/03/grammar-constraints/) - how BuilderBrain enforces formal structure in generated outputs.

*The dual-rail architecture represents a fundamental shift: instead of replacing pretrained models, we're extending them with compositional capabilities while preserving their strengths.*
