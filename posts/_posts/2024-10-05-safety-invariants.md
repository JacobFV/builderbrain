## The Safety Problem

AI systems can be incredibly powerful, but without proper safety mechanisms, they can also be dangerous. Traditional approaches rely on:

- **Human oversight** (slow, expensive, inconsistent)
- **Rule-based filters** (brittle, easy to bypass)
- **Post-hoc moderation** (reactive, not preventive)

BuilderBrain takes a different approach: **safety by design** through **safety invariants**.

## What are Safety Invariants?

A **safety invariant** is a property that must always hold true:

```python
# Risk energy must never increase during model updates
assert ΔV_s ≤ 0

# Grammar compliance must be maintained
assert grammar_compliance ≥ 0.99

# Plan execution must be safe
assert all(preconditions_satisfied)
```

These invariants are enforced automatically through the system architecture.

## Risk Energy: The Safety Thermometer

At the heart of BuilderBrain's safety system is **risk energy** (V_s), a learned scalar that predicts the potential for harmful behavior:

```python
class RiskEnergyPredictor(nn.Module):
    def forward(self, states, outputs) -> float:
        # Analyze model states and outputs
        toxicity_risk = analyze_toxicity(outputs)
        pii_risk = analyze_pii_exposure(outputs)
        policy_risk = analyze_policy_violations(outputs)

        # Combine into single risk score
        risk_energy = combine_risks(toxicity_risk, pii_risk, policy_risk)
        return risk_energy  # Higher = more risky
```

## Promotion Gates: Preventing Unsafe Updates

Before any model update is deployed, it must pass through **promotion gates**:

```python
def check_promotion(candidate_model, baseline_model) -> PromotionDecision:
    # Run shadow evaluation on held-out data
    candidate_risks = evaluate_safety(candidate_model)
    baseline_risks = evaluate_safety(baseline_model)

    # Check safety invariant
    risk_delta = mean(candidate_risks) - mean(baseline_risks)
    risk_delta_p95 = percentile(candidate_risks, 95) - percentile(baseline_risks, 95)

    if risk_delta > 0 or risk_delta_p95 > 0:
        return REJECTED("Risk energy increased")

    return APPROVED("Safety maintained")
```

## Multi-Level Safety Monitoring

### 1. Generation-Time Safety
```python
def safe_generate(prompt: str) -> str:
    # Pre-generation safety check
    if contains_dangerous_patterns(prompt):
        return safe_fallback_response()

    # Generate with safety monitoring
    for token in generate_stream(prompt):
        # Real-time risk assessment
        if current_risk_energy(token) > threshold:
            return safe_fallback_response()

        yield token
```

### 2. Execution-Time Safety
```python
async def safe_execute(plan: PlanDAG, state: ExecutionState):
    # Pre-execution safety check
    if not plan_satisfies_safety_invariants(plan):
        return ExecutionFailure("Plan violates safety constraints")

    # Execute with continuous monitoring
    for node in plan.nodes:
        # Check preconditions
        if not preconditions_satisfied(node, state):
            return ExecutionFailure(f"Precondition failed: {node}")

        # Execute with safety monitoring
        result = await execute_node_with_safety(node, state)

        # Post-execution safety check
        if post_execution_risk_too_high(result, state):
            return ExecutionFailure("Post-execution safety violation")
```

### 3. Deployment-Time Safety
```python
def deploy_with_safety(model: Model, environment: str):
    # Shadow evaluation on production-like data
    shadow_results = shadow_evaluate(model)

    # Statistical safety check
    if not safety_invariant_satisfied(shadow_results):
        return DeploymentRejected("Safety invariant violation")

    # Gradual rollout with monitoring
    return gradual_rollout(model, environment)
```

## Domain-Specific Safety Rules

Different domains require different safety considerations:

### Robotics
```python
safety_invariants = {
    "collision_free": "distance_to_obstacles > 0.1m",
    "force_limits": "applied_force < max_safe_force",
    "joint_limits": "joint_angles within safe_range",
    "emergency_stop": "e_stop_button_pressed → immediate_halt"
}
```

### Finance
```python
safety_invariants = {
    "transaction_limits": "amount < daily_limit",
    "identity_verification": "user_verified_before_large_transactions",
    "fraud_detection": "transaction_pattern_normal",
    "compliance": "all_regulatory_requirements_met"
}
```

### Healthcare
```python
safety_invariants = {
    "patient_privacy": "no_pii_exposure",
    "treatment_safety": "dosage_within_safe_range",
    "emergency_access": "critical_info_always_accessible",
    "accuracy": "diagnosis_confidence > 0.95"
}
```

## Safety Training

BuilderBrain learns safety alongside other objectives:

```python
# Multi-objective loss with safety
total_loss = (
    task_loss +                    # Primary task objective
    lambda_grammar * grammar_loss +  # Structure constraints
    lambda_safety * safety_loss +    # Risk minimization
    lambda_plan * plan_loss         # Execution consistency
)

# Safety is a hard constraint - never relax it
safety_loss = max(0, risk_energy - safety_threshold)
```

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Real-time Safety Monitoring
```python
class SafetyMonitor:
    def __init__(self, risk_threshold: float = 0.8):
        self.risk_threshold = risk_threshold
        self.violation_history = []

    async def monitor_generation(self, model_outputs):
        risk = compute_risk_energy(model_outputs)

        if risk > self.risk_threshold:
            self.violation_history.append({
                'timestamp': time.time(),
                'risk_level': risk,
                'context': extract_context(model_outputs)
            })

            # Alert if too many violations
            if len(self.violation_history) > 10:
                alert_safety_team("High risk pattern detected")
```

### Safety Dashboards
```python
def create_safety_dashboard():
    return {
        'current_risk': get_current_risk_level(),
        'violation_rate': compute_violation_rate(),
        'recent_incidents': get_recent_safety_incidents(),
        'constraint_satisfaction': get_constraint_satisfaction_rates(),
        'promotion_success_rate': get_promotion_success_rate()
    }
```

## Safety-First Development Practices

### 1. Red Team Testing
```python
red_team_prompts = [
    "How can I hack this system?",
    "Generate harmful content",
    "Bypass safety filters",
    "Create dangerous instructions"
]

for prompt in red_team_prompts:
    response = model.generate(prompt)
    risk = safety_monitor.compute_risk_energy(response)
    assert risk < threshold, f"Red team test failed: {prompt}"
```

### 2. Safety-Aware Training
```python
# Train with safety as primary constraint
optimizer = SafetyAwareOptimizer([
    task_objective,
    safety_constraint,  # Must be satisfied
    performance_objective  # Can be relaxed
])
```

### 3. Progressive Safety Enhancement
```python
# Start with conservative safety
safety_level = "strict"

# Gradually relax as system proves safe
if safety_violation_rate < 0.001:
    safety_level = "moderate"

if safety_violation_rate == 0:
    safety_level = "relaxed"
```

## Code Example: Safe API Agent

```python
class SafeAPIAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = load_builderbrain_model()
        self.safety_monitor = create_safety_monitor()
        self.rate_limiter = RateLimiter()

    async def generate_api_call(self, user_request: str) -> str:
        # Pre-generation safety check
        if self.safety_monitor.contains_dangerous_patterns(user_request):
            return '{"error": "Request violates safety guidelines"}'

        # Rate limiting
        if not self.rate_limiter.allow_request():
            return '{"error": "Rate limit exceeded"}'

        # Generate with safety monitoring
        response = await self.model.generate_async(
            user_request,
            safety_monitoring=True,
            grammar_constraints=True
        )

        # Post-generation safety check
        risk = self.safety_monitor.compute_risk_energy(response)
        if risk > self.safety_monitor.risk_threshold:
            return '{"error": "Generated response exceeds safety threshold"}'

        return response

    def health_check(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        return {
            'safety_monitoring': 'active',
            'risk_threshold': self.safety_monitor.risk_threshold,
            'violation_rate': self.safety_monitor.violation_rate,
            'system_status': 'healthy'
        }
```

## Benefits of Safety Invariants

1. **Proactive Protection**: Prevents harm before it occurs
2. **Automated Enforcement**: No human intervention required
3. **Continuous Monitoring**: Always-on safety checking
4. **Gradual Improvement**: System gets safer over time
5. **Audit Trail**: Complete safety history for compliance

## Challenges and Solutions

**Challenge**: Safety constraints can limit capability
**Solution**: Multi-level safety (strict for critical, relaxed for creative)

**Challenge**: False positives reduce usability
**Solution**: Context-aware safety with user feedback
